This project is going to be a mock website for my club hockey team. 
It includes our roster, team picture, stats, and our schedule. 
The image for youtube, ACHA, and my personal webite are all active links that open in other tabs.
This is the first project so I hope to expand on this to practice and demonstrate website building skills.
